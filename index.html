    <h1>CardHero Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h3>Our Approach to Privacy</h3>
    <p>At CardHero, we prioritize the privacy and security of our users. We want you to know that we take your personal information seriously and are committed to safeguarding it.</p>
    <p>One of the key aspects of our privacy approach is that we do not store any settings besides those defined by the store owner. This means that any customization and configuration settings you apply to your CardHero account are only stored locally on your device and are not transmitted or stored on our servers.</p>
    <p>We believe that this approach helps to enhance your privacy and gives you more control over your data.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please don't hesitate to contact our support team.</p>
